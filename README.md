Beginner solo hack for HackRU Spring 2014
Created a simple chrome extension where each click of the icon pops up a small window illustrating some of the most entertaining pages

uses both HTML and JS

uses a change site button to cycle through the sites

Files uploaded include:
manifest.json
icon.png
popup.html
popup.js

To use the extension, download all files to one directory. Then go to chrome://extensions and in the upper right hand corner, check the box for Developer mode if not already done. 

Click on load unpacked extension...
and pick the directory that contaains the omfgDOGS files. A star icon should then appear on your browser next to all the other extensions you've downloaded.

Not officially on the chrome webstore yet (4/13/14)
